# Detecting a number from an image (Machine Learning)
> This is a simple image classification model that detects a number from an image using a random forest algorithm.

> The image is converted to a vector and then the vector is classified as a number.

> This model is capable of predicting numbers from images with an accuracy rate of up to 98.06%.
